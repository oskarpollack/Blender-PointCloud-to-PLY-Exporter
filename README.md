# BlenderPointCloudExporter
A Python script for Blender that exports a pointcloud with colour to a .ply file.

Download the .py file. In Blender go to the Scripting tab and open the .py file.
Select the pointcloud (a mesh with only vertices) and run the script. 
The pointcloud will be stored in a .ply file named like the selected object at the location of the Blender file.
